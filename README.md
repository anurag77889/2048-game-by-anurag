# 2048-game-by-anurag
A simple sliding tile game inspired by the popular 2048 puzzle. Players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid, merging tiles with the same number to create larger values. The goal is to reach 2048 or beyond while keeping the board from filling up!

## 🎮 How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to slide the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same value will merge into one when they collide.
- A new tile (2 or 4) is randomly placed on the board after each valid move.
- Keep sliding and merging tiles to achieve higher numbers.
- The game ends when no valid moves are left.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Random Tile Generation**: A new tile is generated at a random empty spot after every valid move.
- **Dynamic Merging**: Merge adjacent tiles with the same value to create higher-valued tiles.
- **Color Changes**: The tiles change colors dynamically based on their value.
- **Keyboard and Swipe Controls**: Control the game using arrow keys or swipe gestures (on touch-enabled devices).

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the board and tiles.
- **JavaScript**: For the core game logic, including movement, merging, and tile generation.
- **DOM Manipulation**: To update the grid after every move and display the current state of the board.
